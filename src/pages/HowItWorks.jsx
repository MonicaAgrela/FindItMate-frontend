        How many times have we traveled and lost something? How many times do we
        leave the house for a simple walk by the sea or in a park and leave
        something there? How many times do we just go for a coffee, buy
        something or even be chatting with someone and miss something? Well,
        we've all been there, and that's where FindItMate was born, the site
        where you can find items that you've lost, as well as insert items that
        you found and that their owner certainly misses. Sign up on our
        website and find out more about how to find something you missed or
        enter something you found.
